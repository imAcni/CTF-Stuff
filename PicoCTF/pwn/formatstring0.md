This challenge has a format string vulnerability. 

1st pick: 
Breakf@st_Burger
Gr%114d_Cheese
Bac0n_D3luxe

Condition to satsify:
```
if (count > 2 * BUFSIZE) {
    serve_bob();
}
```
This checks if the printed characters exceed 64 bytes.

The trick is that %114 in Gr%114d_Cheese, where %114 tells printf to print a number with a width of 114 characters. If no number is provided it will spew out garbage data, making it go to 114 characters, which matches the requirement. 

With the Cla%sic_Che%s%steak one, you have to make the program crash. 

when printf comes across %s without a string argument, it makes the program crash, giving you the flag.
